# Things Just Happened
# Rutgers 2021 Thesis Site


We are using the <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">Papa.parse library</a> to read data from a google spreadsheet. Students upload their work to a google form which is then ported to said spreadsheet.
<strong>This site is only going to work if it's on the internet or on a local server!</strong> To run a local server, run "terminal" or "command prompt" and run the command <code>python -m http.server</code> or <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> (whichever one works, really, and you might even need to <a href="http://littlecolumns.com/tools/python-wrangler/">install Python</a>). Then visit <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000</a> and you'll be all set.
